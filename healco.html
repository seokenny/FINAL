                            <p class="work_box-text-para">HealCo 1.0 felt impersonal with no illustrations and lack of complementing colors. It felt very barebone, empty, and incomplete. One other big issue was that users had a difficult time finding the information they needed. Users would have to navigate through multiple sections and links to finally get to what they want. This caused a lot of frustration and confusion.
